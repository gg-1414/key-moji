Learned:
- How to work with keyCodes
- Discovered filter hue rotate (love it)
- Really understand the concept and use of re-usable components (populating same components with different data, aka emojis)
- Creating hexagons with CSS
- Fixed a bug where a question mark appears when a user deletes an emoji from the textBox
  - Fixed using regex to check whether a value to be deleted is not a number or letter (aka if it is an emoji)
